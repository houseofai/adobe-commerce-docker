# Adobe Commerce environment on Docker (formerly Adobe Magento Cloud)

*Note:* This integration should be used for demo or development purposes only as it is not configured for production.


### Two versions exist:
- A **Microservices** version, using Docker Compose, which is not pre-built. See `README` in the `microservices` folder for more information.

- A **Standalone** version, with everything packed in one image for convenience. Images are built and available on Docker Hub. See `README` in the `standalone` folder for more information.
